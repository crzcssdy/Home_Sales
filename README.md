# Assignment 22: SparkSQL

## Background
In this challenge, I utilized my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Acknowledgments
The SparkSQL Challenge was created as an assignment for the University of California, Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp - June 2024 Cohort under the instruction and guidance of Melissa Engle (Instructor) and Mitchell Stone (TA).
The practical exercises and coding examples demonstrated through the bootcamp helped inform and inspire the code for this project.
